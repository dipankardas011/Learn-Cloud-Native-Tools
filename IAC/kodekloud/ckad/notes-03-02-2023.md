# validating and mutating admission controller

example of defaultStorageClass
if you have applyed pvc and didn't mentioned the storage class the controller will add the default storage class which is set
and thus its a mutating admission controller

mutating admission controler is called first then the validating controller are called

to add custom ones
- MutatingAdmissionWebhook
- ValidatingAdmissionWebhook

for custom admission webhoook
1. create a deploymnet, service in k8s or vm on outside k8s
2. create ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and specify the `url` if the ewebhook server is outside the k8s
or add the service of the webhook
as it is the tls communication the ca certificate bundle needs to be specified

under rules we specify when we want the webhook to be called
