# architecting serverless applications

At a high level, there are three migration patterns that you might follow to migrate your legacy applications to a serverless model. To learn more, expand each of the following three categories:

- leapfrog
- organic
- strangler

## here are the migration questions you need to answer:

* What does this application do and how are its components organized?
* How can you break your data needs up based on the command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern?
* How does the application scale and what components drive the capacity you need?
* Do you have schedule-based tasks?
* Do you have workers listening to a queue?
* Where can you refactor or enhance functionality without impacting the current implementation?
