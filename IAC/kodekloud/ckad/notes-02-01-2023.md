# design pattern

- sidecar
logging container which gets logs from the container and sends it to log server

- adapter
different containers will create different format of logs so as to make them uniform 

- ambassador
you have dev, test, prod DB
you have a container which has to access the DB based on it stage so to make the business logic not affected during this stage transmission we can make the container refer to the localhost and the helper container acts as a proxy to route the traffic i.e. localhost -> different DB based on the stage hence eleminating the need to modify the codebase
