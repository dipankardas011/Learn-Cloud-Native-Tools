# Necessary concepts of Operating Systems for a software engineer

# What is it
Operating system is a set of programs which acts as a interface between User and Hardware. it is neccessary to reduce complexity

## Modes in a OS
1. User mode
2. Supervisor mode (i.e. Kernel mode)

user application are provided API's by OS to talk with the hardware.

for example.

## Components
1. Process management
1. File management
1. Memory management
1. I/O management

# process scheduling

# Memory management

# deadlock

# concurrency

# memory

# IO
Buffer is used to speed up the process because the I/O significantly slower compared to the CPU so CPU had to wait.
* Single buffer
* Double Buffer
* circular buffer
