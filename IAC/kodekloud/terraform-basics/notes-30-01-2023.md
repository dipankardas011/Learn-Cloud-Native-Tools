to bring the resources which are not under terrafrom control we can use
```bash
terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <attribute>
```

terraform import only updates the terraform state file not the terraform config files

so the first time you import you will revive the error

we can fix it by 
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "webserver-2" {
  # resource argument
}
```
then we can run the import command and now it will work without errors

then we can add the required configs for above resource block imported and then with terraform plan terraform will refresh its state
