# OS upgrades
## what is pod eviction timeout
the time the pods wait till the pods are evicated from the given node provided the node is down more than or equal to the specified 
```
kube-controller-manager --pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s
```

instead we can do better
we can drain the node and all the current workloads are moved to toher nodes (not moved techinally but thet are gracefully terminated and recreated in other nodes)
also the node is marked as corden or unschedulable

then we need to uncorden the node


there is also another option
corden which marks a given node as unschedulable
