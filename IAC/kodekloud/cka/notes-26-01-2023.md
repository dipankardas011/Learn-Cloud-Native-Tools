# static pods

kubelet is only present in node
along with docker
manifest file present in this directory or any other custom e directory
will be searched by kubelet in some duration
/etc/kubernetes/manifests

it  has no kubernetes components so you have to use docker commands to look

then if you have connected the conotrolplane and apiserver via the 
kubectl you can still get the static pods created before
it creates the mirror of kubelet to the apiserver
you can only view the details of the static pods but no edit or modify them as 
you have to edit from the filelocation

also the pod name is appended by the nodename
ex. static-web
then it becomes `static-web-node01`

## where is it used
for master nodes
the apiserver , controller-manager, etcd.yaml are placed in the abpve mentioned directory and kubelet takes care of them 

this is how the kubeadm setups the control-planes

> Note coredns is not deployed as a static pod
> also kube proxy

some tips gatherd
```bash
use journalctl -xeu kubelet to get the static pod address
or ps -aux | grep kubelet

ssh into localte the folder and delete or add new pod defination files
```
