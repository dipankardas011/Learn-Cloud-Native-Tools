# Vault Groups
when we are using external groups we configure the external identity provider like LDAP, oidC, etc. then we mao the external ploicies and groups to the internal groups. 


Internal groups can be used to easily manage permissions for entities

So to avoid the duplication of identical auth menthod on every single namespace we use the Root Namespace and child namespace where to propagate permissions down to child namesapces

Basically the members will login using the root namespace and oidc and then they will move to the finance namespace inorder to work in thay finance namespace

and so they will be limitd to the polici(s) in that finance namespace
