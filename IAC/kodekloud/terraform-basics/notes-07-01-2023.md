# count

underariable effects when first eleme is deleted from the list then as all elements are shofted in dex they are also get replaced even when unrelated resource "file is removed"
to vercome this issue we use [foreach](#for_each)
# for_each

it works only on maps or set not on list

# for provider versioning
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "1.4.0"

      # for any version except 2.0.0
      version = "!= 2.0.0"
      
      # for any verison below certain version
      version = "< 1.4.0"

      # for range
      version = "> 1.2.0, < 2.0.0, != 1.4.0"

      # to download this version or any incremental version provided here 1.2, 1.3,...,1.9
      version = "~> 1.2"

      # also another example here 1.2.0,1.2.1,...,1.2.9
      version = "~> 1.2.0"
    }
  }
}
```
