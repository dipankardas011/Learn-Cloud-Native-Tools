scheduling queue

the requests based on priority are sorted in the scheduling queeu itself

filtering
this is where the pods which cannot run are filtered out the nodes

scoring
where the different nodes are scored accorigin to their weights

> lets explain
```
pod has request of 10 cores

and 2 nodes with (12, 16 cores) respectively

after scoring the left amt of resources it taken into consideration
like (2, 6) respectively

```

so the second node will have higher score

and finally
binding phase the node is bound with the highest score
