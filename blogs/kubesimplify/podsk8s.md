# What is Pod?
It is the smallest deployable and schedulable unit that Kubernetes can manage.
It is a best practice that we keep one container inside a given pod, but we can place more than one container inside a pod. Each Pod has its own local IP address inside the cluster

# Layout of Kubernetes Pods
`Pod` is a collection of `container(s)`

`Deployment` is a collection of `Pod(s)`

# Pod lifecycle

When we 
```bash
kubectl apply -f <fileName> 
```
then
**kubectl**  converts the `YAML` manifest to `JSON` file and sends it to **api server**


**api server** authenticate using kubeconfig auth and checks whether the user is authorized or not to a particular functionality (i.e. creation, deletion) (i.e. RBAC) 

when it is authorized, all that the data gets persisted to the **etcd** 😇 here state becomes `Pending`

Now the **Scheduler** comes and it finds the best match of the node where it will be running (i.e. iterate through all the nodes in the cluster to get the best possible Node based on the resources or images pulled )

after getting it sends the labels filled with spec <node name> to the **api** server now that particular request is also stored on the **etcd** 😇 here state becomes `Container Creating`

**api server** instructs the **kubelet** of that particular node about the pod spec which has to be created.

**kubelet** is responsible to fetch the image from **image registry**. The **cri** gets the ip attached to the pod which is in turn send to the **api server** and again data is stored  in **etcd** 😇 here state becomes `Running`

Whenever the container dies too many times then 😇 here state becomes `Crash loop back off`
and whenever the container succeded then 😇 here state becomes `succeeded`

# Hooks

actions that you want to before the container starts

**Pre-stops hooks**
When the container has begun terminating then this command is executed

**Post-start hook**
When the container starts then only this is executed

**Init container**
it runs before running the workload container(s)

---

# Init containers

They are container(s) that run to completion and run before the main container starts

**use case**
* To change the file structure of the mounted volume
* Added configuration to the mounted volume
* It can be used to delay the start-up of the main container so that certain checks are done beforehand
However, if the Pod has a `restartPolicy` of Never, and an init container fails during the startup of that Pod, Kubernetes treats the overall Pod as failed.

When all the init containers are ✅👍🏼 then only the workload container will start
there is 🚫 Liveliness, Readiness probe

---

# Multiple container pod
**use cases**

* For logging purposes of the main application container
* It can be used to act as a reverse proxy to get the static files

---

# Health Checks

**Liveliness probe**
It checks whether the pod is alive or dead
/health

**Readiness probe**
It checks whether the pod can get or post requests.
/ready

**Startup probe**
It checks whether the application within the container is started. All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided until it succeeds.

if it fails then 😇 here state becomes `Crash loop back off`

**http**
```yml
- name: probes
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
```

**tcp**
```yml
- name: probes
  livenessProbe:
    tcpSocket:
      port: 80
```

**exec**
```yml
- name: probes
  livenessProbe:
    exec:
      command:
      - cat
      - /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

* `initialDelaySeconds` - before any probes start time to delay its start check
* `periodSeconds` - the time between one probe check to another
* `timeoutSeconds` - [kubelet]() will wait for this much time for response
* `successThreshold` - how many times we want the probe to be successful to mark it as `SUCCESSFUL`
* `failureThreahold` - how many failures will make kublet restart the container

## Limits
**Memory**
If the current usage of memory is more than the allowed then OOME (Out Of Memory Exception) and then 😇 here state becomes `Crash loop back off`

**CPU**
If the current usage of CPU is more than the allowed then 😇 here state becomes `Crash loop back off`

# Volumes

## Empty Dir
* ❌ Saving critical data
* gets created as soon as the pod is assigned to the node
* stay throughout the life-span of the pod
* when pod deleted it also deleted

```yaml
volumes:
- name: test-vol
  emptyDir: {}
```

## Hostpath
* ❌ Saving critical data
* it mounts a file or a directory from the node's file system into the pod

```yaml
volumes:
- name: test-hostpath
  hostPath:
    path: /dd
    type: DirectoryOrCreate
```
